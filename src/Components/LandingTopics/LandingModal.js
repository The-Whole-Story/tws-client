          Articles presented on the home page contain a topic and related
          categories. Upon clicking on a card you would be presented with a
          chain of articles from different credible sources having to do with
          the topic and categories mentioned. As a user, you can choose a topic
          selected for you, or search for your own. Unlike other sites that
          redirect you to a list of flashy article titles designed to grab your
          attention, The Whole Storyâ€™s search will lead to a list of subtopics,
          where you can choose any topic that interests you free of any external
          influences. You will then be served a group of articles, all centered
          around your chosen topic, where the articles come from different
          perspectives and sources so that you can grasp the whole story.
